My implementation for the fifth project. The project renders the yoda texture to a texture, and then use that texture as color textures to draw the teapot. This is slightly different from the project requirement but I think this looks more interesting.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=5

All CS6610 and optional requirements implemented.

Controls:

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

shift+left drag: rotate camera in the indirect scene (yoda)
shift+right drag/shift+wheel: change camera distance in the indirect scene (yoda)

(I didn't use alt modifier because alt+<key> is reserved by my X window manager).

p: perspective/orthographic projection
a: show/hide axis
f6: reload shader
esc: quit
