My implementation for the 7th project. This project renders a teapot on a plane with shadow enabled.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=7

All CS6610 and optional requirements implemented. In addition, I also implemented the following extra features/optimization:

- visualize shadow map for debugging
- toggle between spot light and directional light
- fix shadow acne and peter panning
- border clamp for shadow maps
- only render backface in shadow pass

Controls:

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

shift+left drag: rotate light position/direction

x: toggle between directional light and spot light
s: toggle shadow map visualization

p: perspective/orthographic projection
a: show/hide axis
f6, r: reload shader
esc: quit
