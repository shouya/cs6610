My implementation for the 8th project. This project renders a flat plane and creates the illusion of a teapot using a displacement map and a normal map.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=8

All CS6610 and optional requirements are implemented. In addition, I also implemented the following extra features:

- parallax occulusion mapping
  + Note: shadow map for parallax mapping mode is not implemented.
  + Note: an optional color texture.
- on-the-fly detail level adjustment
- on-the-fly displacement scale adjustment
- cycle among draw modes
  + tessellation
  + wireframe
  + tessellation with wireframe overlay
  + parallax
- features from previous projects
  + shadow map visualization
  + toggleable axis
  + toggleable perspective/orthographic camera
  + toggleable directional/spot light

Controls:

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

shift+left drag: rotate light position/direction

w: cycle between draw modes (tessellation, wireframe, parallax)
left and right: adjust detail level (tessellation level or steep parallax mapping layers)
up and down: adjust displacement scale

x: toggle between directional light and spot light
s: toggle shadow map visualization
p: toggle between perspective and orthographic projection
a: toggle axis

f6/r: reload shaders
esc: quit
