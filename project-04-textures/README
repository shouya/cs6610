My implementation for the fourth project. Renders the teapot/yoda model with textures.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=4

All CS6610 and optional requirements implemented.

Controls:

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

p: perspective/orthographic projection
a: show/hide axis
f6: reload shader
esc: quit

Note: loading the yoda model can take up to a minute because of the triangle strip processing.
