My implementation for the third project. Shows the shaded teapot in various shading modes.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=3

All CS6610 and optional requirements implemented.

Controls:

0-9: Render in specific mode:
  - 0: Default (FullBlinn)
  - 1: SurfaceNormal
  - 2: Depth
  - 3: ViewPosition
  - 4: Diffuse
  - 5: SpecularBlinn
  - 6: FullBlinn
  - 7: SpecularBlinn
  - 8: FullPhong
  - 9: Plain

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

p: perspective/orthographic projection
a: show/hide axis
t: switch between teapots built from different mesh modes
  - triangle strip with element index
    by default shows debugging color for different strips, start the application with
    NO_DEBUG_TRIANGLE_STRIP=1 environment to render the mesh normally
  - triangle list
  - triangle list with element index

  Note: all these modes should render exactly the same.

esc: quit
