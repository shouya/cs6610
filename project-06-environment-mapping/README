My implementation for the 6th project. The project renders three teapots (one normal + two reflective), plus a reflective plane with animated ripples.

https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/?prj=6

All CS6610 and optional requirements implemented. In addition, I have implemented the following optimizations:

- Gradual cubemap update trick: In each frame only one face of the cube-map is updated.
  + The computation becomes 1/6 at a small cost of latency
  + Recursive reflection is also functioning.
- The reflection on the plane is physically accurate that includes other objects.
- The reflected scene rendered in the reflective plane's internal texture only will render the necessary part used by the plane.
- Backface culling working as expected.

Controls:

left drag: rotate camera
right drag/wheel: change camera distance

shift+left drag: rotate camera in the indirect scene (yoda)
shift+right drag/shift+wheel: change camera distance in the indirect scene (yoda)

(I didn't use alt modifier because alt+<key> is reserved by my X window manager).

p: perspective/orthographic projection
a: show/hide axis
f6, r: reload shader
esc: quit

Environments:

- SLOW_CUBEMAP_UPDATE=1: slow down cubemap updating to ~1/10 of original frequency to allow you more clearly notice the latency.
